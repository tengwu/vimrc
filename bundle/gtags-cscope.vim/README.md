GNU GLOBAL is a source code tagging system that works the same way across diverse environments (emacs, vi, less, bash, web browser, etc). You can locate symbols in source files and move there easily. It is useful for hacking a large project containing many sub-directories, many #ifdef and many main() functions. It is similar to ctags or etags but is different from them at the point of independence of any editor. It runs on a UNIX(POSIX) compatible operating system like GNU and BSD.

GNU GLOBAL is part of the GNU project, and is free software. You can freely copy, modify and redistribute this program under GNU GPL.
